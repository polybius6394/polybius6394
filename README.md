Hey, I'm polybius6394 (or poly on most platforms).

I make mods for Arma 3 and Arma Reforger (primarily the latter now).
Unfortunately, due to some stuff out of my control, I've lost the source files for a good number of my mods. Anything I still have the source material for will be uploaded here to Github.
I'm happy to listen to any requests you may have, but I can't promise that anything will actually get done, as I generally only work on stuff that interests me.

Pretty much anything I make, unless specified otherwise, is licensed under APL-SA.
Basically, that means that you can modify, redistribute, whatever, as long as;
- Credit is given
- The subsequent material is also under APL-SA
- The content stays in the Arma series
- The content is not modified

Now, that's what I gathered from skimming the license, but if you really want to be sure, you can read the full text with the link below.

Ah, also, feel free to expand upon my work without directly contacting me. I'm generally slow to respond and my answer will probably be yes anyhow.

If you need to contact me, for any reason, you can message me on Discord @ polybius.6394 or email me at polybius6394.public@gmail.com. Discord is the fastest way to reach me.

Thanks for stopping by.
